## Domino Poker (ENG)

### Game Objective

Domino Poker is an individual domino game for four players who aim to score points by accurately taking previously bid tricks. Strategic planning and interference with opponents are essential for winning.

### Required Materials

* Domino set: Double-six domino set (28 tiles).
* Scoring sheet.

### Game Start

1. **Determining the Mixer**:

   * Shuffle tiles, each player draws one tile. Highest sum player shuffles first.

### Gameplay

Each round consists of several phases:

#### 1. Shuffling

* Mixer shuffles the dominoes thoroughly.

#### 2. Drawing

* Each player draws 7 dominoes.
* Opponents draw first, followed by the mixer.

#### 3. Bidding

Each player bids how many tricks they plan to take (0-7). Bidding occurs once around, starting to the left of the mixer and ending with the mixer.

#### 4. Play

* Mixer starts the first move.
* Players can start with any tile.
* If started with an ace, others must follow with an ace if available.
* If the requested tile is unavailable, players may discard any other tile or use a trump.
* Trump order (highest first): 0-0, 1-1, 1-6, 1-5, 1-4, 1-3, 1-2, 1-0.
* Ace order: 6-6, 5-5, 4-4, 3-3, 2-2, 0-6. (0-6 allows requesting "6".)

#### 5. Scoring

After seven rounds, scores are evaluated:

* +15 points for each accurately taken trick.
* +5 points for each trick above the bid.
* -5 points for each missed trick up to the bid.
* +30 points if exactly 7 tricks were bid and achieved.
* -30 points if all 7 tricks were bid but not achieved.

### Winning the Game
